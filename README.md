# Prakriti

**Prakriti** is a simple and interactive Ayurvedic web app that helps users discover their natural body type — or *dosha* — based on ancient Ayurvedic principles. Built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, this project includes a smooth sign-up and sign-in system powered by **localStorage**, along with a fun quiz that reveals your dominant dosha: **Vata, Pitta,** or **Kapha**. The design is clean, modern, and easy to use — perfect for beginners learning web development or anyone interested in Ayurveda.


## How to Run the Project

1. **Create a project folder:**
   Start by making a new folder on your computer and name it something like **“prakriti-app.”**

2. **Add the files:**
   Inside this folder, save the following three HTML files:

   * `index.html` → for the **Sign In** page
   * `signup.html` → for the **Sign Up** page
   * `prakriti.html` → for the **Prakriti test and results** page

   Make sure all three files are in the same directory so the navigation links work properly.

3. **Open the app:**
   Once all files are ready, right-click on `index.html` and choose **“Open with” → your web browser** (like Chrome, Edge, or Firefox).
   This will launch the app starting from the **Sign In** page.

4. **Try it out:**

   * If you’re new, click on the **Sign Up** link to create your account.
   * Enter your email and password — everything is stored securely in your browser using **localStorage**, so no backend setup is needed.
   * After signing up, log in with your credentials to access the **Prakriti Test**.
   * Answer a few quick questions to discover your Ayurvedic dosha type and get a brief explanation of your result.

5. **Optional — Run locally or host online:**
   You can open the app directly in your browser or use **VS Code’s Live Server** for a smoother local experience.
   To make it accessible online, simply upload the folder to **GitHub Pages**, and your project will be live on the web.
